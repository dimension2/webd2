<h4><strong>Work Experience</strong></h4>
<hr />
<h5>Education Technical Evangelist</h5>
<p>MathWorks<br />
Sep. 2013 – present  </p>
<p>Worked closely with STEM educators at leading higher education universities, supporting computational and curriculum needs with MATLAB towards enhancing undergraduate learning.</p>
<h6>Internal accomplishments</h6>
<ul>
<li>Played a key role in increasing awareness and adoption of MathWorks products within the academic community. </li>
<li>Developed pipelines for customer segmentation, data acquisition and wrangling from internal BO and SQL databases and external university websites and APIs. Created customized front-end dashboards summarizing adoption at universities.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Customer Interactions</h6>
<ul>
<li>Provided close technical guidance to over 500 educators over one-on-one interactions, on incorporating computational content, autograding workflow and project-based learning in teaching. </li>
<li>Delivered presentations and workshops at conferences to promote computational thinking, use of technology in pedagogy, and teaching with hardware (Raspberry Pi, LEGO, Android/iOS devices) in higher education.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Entrepreneurial Lead</h5>
<p>NSF I-Corps Program
Jun. 2013 – Aug. 2013 </p>
<ul>
<li>Investigated the market potential for commercialization of doctoral research on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for wildland fire monitoring.</li>
<li>Held discussions with over 100 federal, state and commercial agencies towards requirement and technical feasibility assessment. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Research Assistant</h4>
<p>Co-Operative Distributed Systems Laboratory, University of Cincinnati
Sep. 2009 – Jun. 2013</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed and experimentally implemented a novel cyclic pursuit algorithm in a multi-agent ground-robot system for cooperative perimeter tracking.</li>
<li>Developed a low-dimensional Kalman-filter based spatio-temporal estimation method for monitoring and predicting the growth of forest fires.</li>
<li>Led efforts towards the establishment of an experimental facility for developing and implementing multi-robot distributed navigation and control algorithms. Hardware setup included ground and aerial robotic platforms, a motion tracking system, and wireless communications with remote PC</li>
