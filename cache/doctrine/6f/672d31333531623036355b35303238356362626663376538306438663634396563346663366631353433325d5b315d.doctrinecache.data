a:2:{s:7:"content";s:2394:"<p>Welcome to this part of the interwebs, an online chronicle of the life and times of an evil megalomaniac in the making  a lowly grad student with a habit of throwing stuff online when he isn’t throwing stuff at research (or throwing research at stuff, for that matter). For your convenience and in the general tidiness of things, here’s a handy compendium.</p>

<h1>the site</h1>
<p>is, for most part, <del>an exercise in self-obsession</del> a collection of musings, ramblings and images (metaphorical and otherwise) from the author’s gradlife experiences, over a  seven-year timeline around 2006-2013, at UC and thereabouts. Throw in the occasional gradlife gyaan and a few random takes, and the contents would include everything under the sun, and beyond.</p>
<h1>the author</h1>
<p>was a graduate student until recently, chasing what seemed like a very elusive Ph.D. Recently got out of that all-but-dissertation (ABD) stage of gradlife, and is still finding his feet in the big, bad, world outside academia. Occasional blogger – visits this space in the little gaps in time that research and free food scavenges permit. Finds robots to be brilliant conversationalists, humans, a little less so. Vacillates between bouts of extreme diligence and extreme lethargy. Can sometimes be found awkwardly sprawled on the floor or hanging upside down at random locations, in the often misplaced belief that he is making photographs. That is also the closest to any form of exercise he is known to get. Can, on all other occasions, be found under a comforter pondering about the larger purpose of life. Has shown the ability to survive on anything vegetarian, except perhaps raw foods. Has a strong penchant for books, action comics, vintage cameras, and coffee (filter, instant, free trade, fair trade – the whole lot). Is known to be afraid of cats, dogs and women (though not necessarily in that order). Is strongly allergic to first-hand smoke, dope, liquor, &amp; careless usage of expletives for perceived humor or aggression. Finds the lack of space after a comma highly disturbing. Has a name, but given his new-found penchant for  the self-aggrandizing third-person, refers to himself as ‘the author’ instead – for lack of a more diabolical pseudonym.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
