<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>I am currently an engineer at <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>, makers of MATLAB, in a customer-facing technical role. I work closely with academia to support computational needs and learning initiatives towards enhanced student learning. I have a keen interest, and proficiency, in scientific computing and interactive data visualization. </p>

<p>MATLAB has been my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">hammer</a> for a good part of my career, and I have used it for most of my computing and scripting needs. MATLAB was my tool of choice for much of my doctoral dissertation and Masters thesis work. I also used MATLAB for motion tracking and control of ground and aerial robots over serial communications during my graduate studies.</p>
<p>In my current life, I use MATLAB for data analysis and visualization, scripting and web scraping applications. Beyond its more conventional applications as a computational language, I have used MATLAB to scrape information off of academic websites to run text analytics on university curriculum and course information. I have also used MATLAB to process and analyze large datasets, a specific example being the comparison of airport performance for weather-related delays based on flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics over a five-year period. </p>
