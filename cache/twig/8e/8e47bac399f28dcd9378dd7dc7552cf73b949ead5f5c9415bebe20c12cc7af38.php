<h3>the site</h3>
<p><em>dimension2</em> is, at its essence, a personal blog. The content here would consist largely of interactive data stories and photo essays, with the rare musings or rants on current affairs. You can find a <a href=\"http://dimension2.in/content\">rolling list of topics</a> this blog hopes to touch upon some day.</p>
<h3>the history</h3>
<p>This space has been in the making for a while now. Taking a seat further and further behind academic deadlines, mismanaged commitments, <del>internet distractions</del> <a href=\"https://c.xkcd.com/random/comic/\">XKCD</a>, hunger, poverty and such <del>excuses</del> constraints that graduate life (and now the corporate life) imposes on one, work on this site has been slow, or, as one in academia would say, in progress. It’s taken intermittent bursts of energy (and a lot of coffee) towards chiseling the container, bit by bit, to make the site come out ‘just right’, or something close enough. The idea is to keep this space clean, uncluttered, minimal – much unlike a grad student’s desk.</p>
<p>The site remains work in progress. Bug fixes and under-the-hood tinkering for functionality and aesthetics are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the hope is that the content here takes centerstage and lets the rest fade into the background. </p>

<h3>the author</h3>
<p>... was a graduate student until recently, chasing what seemed like a very elusive Ph.D. Recently got out of that all-but-dissertation stage of gradlife, and is still finding his feet in the big, bad world outside academia. Talked this nice software company into letting him work closely with academia even after graduation, and so he now plays grad student in sheep's clothing, for a living, vacillating between bouts of extreme diligence and extreme lethargy.</p>
<p>Passionate about innovations in education and the use of data for civic and urban innovations, he uses this space as a scratchpad for ideas, interactive data visualization and storytelling. </p>
<p>When not at the keyboard, he can be found awkwardly sprawled on the floor or hanging upside down at random locations, in the often misplaced belief that he is <del>taking</del> making photographs. That is also the closest to any form of exercise he is known to get. Can, on all other occasions, be found under a comforter pondering about the larger purpose of life.  </p>
<p>Has a <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/balajirsharma\">name</a>, but given his new-found penchant for the self-aggrandizing third-person, refers to himself around here as ‘the author’ instead – for lack of a more diabolical pseudonym.</p>";
